# donate

An Angular 1.0 donation form with SASS and Gulpfile.

The APP/JS folder contains an Angular custom directive implementing Angular cookies. There is also some SASS.

The GULPFILE in the root converts and minifies SASS to CSS. JavaScript files are concatenated and minified to a single distribution.

Try the form here http://forth-media.com/git/donate/

The form keeps track of your donations. You can "Save" your activity, else the form reverts on reload.
